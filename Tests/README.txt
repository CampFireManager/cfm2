Please note, at some point, I'll figure out how Unit Testing works. Until then, I've got a few tests I've written for myself.

Feel free to use them :)

If you're going to run the test.sh, at least make sure:
1) you've got the PHP_CodeSniff PEAR module installed
2) the CFM2 directory (in .phpcs) linked or copied to your /usr/share/php/tests/PHP_CodeSniffer/CodeSniffer/Standards
3) You've got phpDocumenter installed (although, to be fair it's currently commented out in the test.sh)
